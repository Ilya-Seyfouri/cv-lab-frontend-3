    },
    {
      question: "How is it different from ChatGPT?",
      answer:

    },
    {
      question: "How does the Cover Letter feature work?",
      answer:
        "The AI drafts a personalized cover letter based on your CV and the job description. It ensures your tone, achievements, and motivation match the company's culture and role requirements. You can fine-tune the letter manually afterward.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does the mock interview feature work?",
      answer:
        "The mock interview tool simulates real interview scenarios using AI-generated questions based on the role and industry. You can answer verbally or in writing, and the AI provides instant feedback on your responses, confidence, and structure.",
    },
    {
      question: "What industries or job markets does it support?",
      answer:
        "Our AI supports a wide range of industries â€” from tech, finance, and healthcare to creative roles and academia. It's trained on thousands of job postings and adapts automatically to different sectors and seniority levels.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a free version?",
      answer:
        "Yes. You can try the platform for free with limited features such as one CV and cover letter optimization. Premium plans unlock unlimited tailoring, advanced analytics, and full mock interview simulations.",
